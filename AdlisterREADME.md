# Adlister Project

This is a project similar to the functionality you would have in Craigslist or similar applications.

Within this application, the user can register a profile, view ads, create ads, delete ads, and search for ads.

As users log in to our application, they are able to see all of the ads they have posted on their profile along with the ability to edit, add, and delete them all from their profile. While on the homepage of the application, users are able to see all ads posted on the application.

Another great feature of our application is that the user can click an ad and the application will redirect the user to another page that displays the individual ad clicked by the user.

Users do not have to be logged in to view ads, but must log in to create,delete, or edit ads.

Customers find our application useful because they can view all ads from a centralized location.
